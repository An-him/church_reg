1. Custom User Model

You could use Django's default User model and extend it with a profile model to capture custom fields like membership status, registration dates, etc.

2. Registration Workflow

First-Time Users: On the registration form, check if the user already exists in the system by asking for a unique identifier (e.g., name, email, phone). If they don't exist, prompt them to register.
Returning Users: Use an autocomplete search (e.g., Django-Autocomplete-Light) to allow users to search for their name, and if found, display their details.
Update Option: If the user selects their name, allow them to either confirm or update their details before submission.

3. Thank-You Message

After successful registration, redirect the user to a "Thank You" page with a personalized message (e.g., "Thank you, John, for joining us today!").
